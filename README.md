# Sentiment Analysis Web App

## Description
The Sentiment Analysis Web App is designed to analyze and predict the sentiment of user-provided text using machine learning. Built with Flask and JavaScript, this application offers a modern and responsive design. It leverages a trained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for sentiment classification.

## Technologies
- **Python**: Backend development
- **Flask**: Web framework for building the application
- **scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for the SVM model
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and preprocessing
- **numpy**: Numerical operations and feature extraction
- **JavaScript**: Frontend interactivity
- **HTML**: Structure and layout of web pages
- **CSS**: Styling and design

## Features
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Provides an intuitive interface for users to input text for sentiment analysis.
- **Real-Time Sentiment Analysis**: Displays sentiment analysis results instantly using the trained machine learning model.
- **Responsive and Modern Design**: Ensures a sleek, modern look that adapts to different devices and screen sizes.
- **SVM Model**: Utilizes a Support Vector Machine for accurate sentiment classification.
- **Data Preprocessing and Feature Extraction**: Handles text data preprocessing and feature extraction with pandas and numpy for model training.
